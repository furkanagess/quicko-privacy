## Quicko – Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-08-19

This Privacy Policy explains how we process information when you use the Quicko mobile application (the "App"). The App provides features such as ads (Google AdMob), in-app purchases, optional Google Play Games Services sign-in, and storing local preferences.

By using the App, you agree to this policy. Please review it periodically.

### 1) Information we collect/process

- Device and usage information: Signals such as device model, OS version, language, and approximate location may be processed by ad networks for ad delivery and fraud prevention.
- Advertising identifier: Your device’s advertising ID (IDFA/AAID) may be used by ad providers for measurement and personalized ads.
- Purchase information: In-app purchases are processed by Google Play or the Apple App Store. We do not access your card data. Store-provided receipts/transaction information may be processed to validate purchase status.
- Game services (optional): If you sign in with Google Play Games Services, your player ID, display name, and related gameplay data provided by Google may be processed by Google. The App does not upload this information to its own servers.
- Local preferences: Settings like sound, language, and test mode are stored locally on your device via SharedPreferences and are not sent to a server.

Note: The App does not include a dedicated analytics SDK; however, ad SDKs may process their own measurement and anti-abuse signals.

### 2) How we use information

- Deliver ads, apply frequency capping, measure performance, and prevent abuse
- Facilitate purchases and maintain subscription/payment status
- Provide optional Google Play Games sign-in experience
- Improve App quality and experience (e.g., error/diagnostic signals)

### 3) Third‑party services

The App uses the following third‑party services, which may process data under their own privacy policies:

- Google AdMob (Google Mobile Ads SDK): ad delivery and measurement. Policies: `https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en` and `https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en`
- Google Play Games Services (Android, optional sign‑in): `https://developer.android.com/games/pgs/android/android-start#step_3_modify_your_code`
- In‑app purchases: Google Play Billing (Android) and Apple App Store (iOS)

### 4) Consent and preference management (GDPR/EEA)

In EEA/UK and similar regions, consent may be required for personalized ads. The App may satisfy these requirements using Google’s User Messaging Platform (UMP) and/or device/store-level consent mechanisms. You can update your choices at any time in device settings or via the consent form when presented.

### 5) Children’s privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has shared information with us, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

### 6) Data retention

- Local preferences: Remain on your device and are removed when you uninstall the App.
- Purchase records: Subject to the retention policies of store providers (Google/Apple). The App stores only the minimum necessary information to reflect subscription/purchase status.
- Ad data: Subject to the retention policies of ad providers.

### 7) Data security

We apply reasonable administrative and technical safeguards. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.

### 8) International transfers

Third‑party providers may use global infrastructure, and data may be transferred internationally. Such transfers are performed under the providers’ contractual protections and applicable regulations.

### 9) Your rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict/oppose processing, and data portability. To exercise your rights, contact us. You can disable personalized ads in device settings and reset your advertising ID.

### 10) “Sale” and “Sharing” (CCPA/CPRA)

We do not sell your personal information. Personalized advertising may be considered “sharing” under some laws. You can disable personalized ads via device/account settings.
